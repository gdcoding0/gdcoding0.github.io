                  unenlightening conversation, put off starting your couch to 5k
                  in favour an easier but unfufilling shortcut. Maybe you forgot
                  to pay a bill on time or prioritized stuff that didn't need as
                  much time as you gave to it. If the above sounds like you (if
                  only a little bit) - you've asked this question and you've
                  experienced the consequences. That looming feeling when we
                  could have got more out of the day and more importantly, more

                  enough and not really aligned with our best interests.
